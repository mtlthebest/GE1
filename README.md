(C) MtL 2013

I'm using this repository, "GE1", as a sandbox for a very small Content Management System, tuned for use at my workplace. The source code I've put here is necessary to run a simple web site. I'm using GitHub to have a back-up copy of my source code, to keep track of changes and to organize the code.

I'm trying to run such web site in these two different environments:

  - a L.A.M.P. (Linux, Apache, MySQL, PHP) platform, using Linux Mint on my notebook;
  - a X.A.M.P.P. (Windows, Apache, MySQL, PHP) platform, using a very old notebook
    and Windows XP to run a web-server at work.

Using two different machines to host the same website really forces you to pay attention to these important aspects:

  - Character encoding (I'm trying to use UTF-8 for everything, and that's not so immediate to obtain...);
  - CSS (Cascade Style Sheets become very useful when you want to obtain a uniform
    aspect for your web pages while using different browsers: Internet Explorer, Google Chrome,
    Mozilla Firefox, Opera...).

The source code is written mainly in PHP. Obviously, I'm also using (X)HTML. I want to use XHTML 1.1 for my web pages. The source code here isn't enough to run the website. It's necessary to use an appropriate MySQL database back-end.

Other languages I'm using are:
  - CSS;
  - SQL.
